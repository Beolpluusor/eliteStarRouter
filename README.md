elite dangerous starrouter program to read scv files
friend used some network site to route path in elite dangeorus. (do not remember the site anymore)

the webpage used scv file as final route table. I decided as a starting program to make a software to open and read scv files so you dont need to use excel or something else to read the file. uploading the route.scv as an example file
